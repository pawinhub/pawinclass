<h1>My Life, My Scolarship</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Shawn Pruttinun, and I love to create and procrastinate.I was born in Chiangmai on the 14th of April, well in my case it was actuallythe 13th night but it was past midnight so that was probably why I am such a light sleeper! Moving on, I grew up in a wonderful family consisting of a brother, a father, and my mom. As a child, we moved to a lot of schools, and consistently homed schooled us to get the Thai certificate too. I was always taught to study hard, and thatâ€™s the only thing living rent-free in my mind that helped me through this pandemic. We moved settlements a few times from living rent to, making our current home. As of right now, we are in Nong Cua, hang dong province, Chiang Mai city.</p>
